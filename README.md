# About me

I graduated from college in programming and university in linguistics in Moscow, Russia. For a long time, I worked as a translator of English and French in Russia, but emigrated from Russia after February 24, 2022, in protest against the war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine. I moved to Armenia, where I studied online courses in web development for two years. Currently, I work as a freelance frontend developer, have the status of an individual entrepreneur in Armenia. I am studying full-stack development. I am interested in collaboration and work on web development with companies, agencies, studios and individuals.
